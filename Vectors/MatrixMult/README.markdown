# Matrix Multiplication

## Hard-Coded vector and matrix

* First in C++ (with C++11 extensions)
* Next in J (version 801)

J is much shorter, but cheats a little due to the fact that the J primitive `i.N` returns `0 1 2 ... N`
which just happens to be the exact values chosen for the C++ program.

Someday revisit to see how the two compare for arbitrary inputs.
