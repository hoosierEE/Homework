# Polyglot Inner Product

Write a matrix multiplication algorithm in C++, learn something about structuring
memory access to better suit the machine, rewrite...

For extra fun, do the same thing in another language.

Finally, benchmark the results.

### C++
1. have C++ compiler
2. compile source code: `g++ innerProduct.cpp -std=c++11`
3. run binary: `./a.out`

### J
1. have J interpreter
2. run program with interpreter: `jconsole < innerProduct.ijs`
